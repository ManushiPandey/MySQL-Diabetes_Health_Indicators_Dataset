# MySQL-Diabetes_Health_Indicators_Dataset
Overview: 

Hi there! Welcome to my project on the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset, a topic that’s both deeply personal and intellectually exciting for me. This dataset is based on the 2015 BRFSS survey, encompassing health-related data from over 441,455 individuals. Why did I choose this? Because diabetes is more than just numbers.It’s a leading health issue affecting millions, including my own family.

Have you ever wondered how factors like BMI, physical activity, or smoking habits contribute to diabetes? Or how machine learning can predict someone’s risk of developing it? That’s what I’ve tried to tackle here. I wanted to dive deep into the data, ask questions, and use my skills in data analysis and machine learning to uncover meaningful insights.

What about you? Have you worked on projects that combine health and tech? If so, I’d love to hear your thoughts or ideas!

Here’s a more personal and conversational version of your README introduction:

## What’s Inside?  

This repository is packed with my journey through this dataset:  

1. Data Cleaning:
 The data was huge and messy. Here, I’ve addressed issues like missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries to prepare the dataset for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Through visualizations like heatmaps, graphs, and statistical summaries, I’ve uncovered patterns and trends within the data to guide further analysis.

4. SQL Database Design:
To manage the large dataset and perform efficient queries, I’ve designed a MySQL database, ensuring that the data is structured in a way that makes it easy to query, analyze, and draw conclusions from.

5. EER Diagram: 
I’ve included the Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER) that visually represents the structure of the database, showing the relationships between different entities and tables.

6. SQL Queries and scripts:
The repository contains SQL queries and scripts used to analyze the data, including examples of complex queries that help extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

My aim isn’t just to showcase technical skills but to highlight the impact we can make when we connect data with real world health challenges. Feel free to explore the notebooks, scripts, and reports and don’t hesitate to share feedback or suggestions.
